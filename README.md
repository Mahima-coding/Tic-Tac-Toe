# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game against another player locally in a web browser.
# How to Play:
1.**Setup**: Open the index.html file in a web browser.

2.Game Start: Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your marker (X or O). Players take turns placing their markers until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

3.Winning: Achieve a row, column, or diagonal of three of your markers in a row to win the game.

4.Draw: If the entire grid is filled without a player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
# File Structure:
index.html: Contains the structure of the webpage, including the game grid and necessary elements for gameplay.
style.css: Defines the visual styles of the game, including grid layout, cell styling, and overall appearance.
app.js: JavaScript code for handling game logic and user interactions. It manages the placement of markers, checks for win/draw conditions, and updates the UI accordingly.
